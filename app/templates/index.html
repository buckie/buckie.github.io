        <p>
            This page is still heavily under construction. It was mostly made to help out a friend I've been mentoring in development.
             Eventually I'll put up some posts about my haskell based CSV cleaner and my work on a Wavelet based 1-D clustering method
            and its applications to financial time series. But for now, my resume will have to do. FYI... pandoc rocks at making resumes!
